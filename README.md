# trial
try something on github

It is the first try on GitHub and this is the link (http://bell-wang.github.io/trial). 

*Very interesting!* 

**it is under pg-github branch**


## **Note**

It showed how to automatically create a Github page using by Github setting and the *Markdown* syntax.

To create a blog page on Github, you can also use Jekyll(http://jekyllrb.com) or R(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxZ8J2rqhEM).
